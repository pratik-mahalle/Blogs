### What is Platform Engineering?

Imagine you have a big toy train set with many different pieces—tracks, trains, tunnels, and bridges. Now, think about how every time you want to add a new piece to your train set, you have to ask an older sibling to do it for you. This can take a long time, and sometimes you might get frustrated because you can't play with your train set the way you want to.

A long time ago, computer programmers were like kids with train sets who had to ask someone else to add new pieces. They needed special people called SysAdmins to set up everything they needed to run their programs. This was slow and frustrating for everyone involved.

#### The DevOps Way: Learning to Do It Yourself

Then, something called DevOps came along. Imagine if your older sibling taught you how to add pieces to your train set by yourself. Now, you can build and play with your train set any way you like, without waiting for help. DevOps taught programmers how to set up and run their own programs, just like learning to add new pieces to your train set.

#### The New Way: Platform Engineering

This is where platform engineering comes in. Imagine if someone built a special toolbox just for your train set. This toolbox has all the tools and pieces you need, organized in a way that makes it super easy to find and use them. Plus, it comes with simple instructions that match how you like to build your train set.

Platform engineers are like the people who create this special toolbox for computer programmers. They build something called an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), which is a set of tools and instructions that make it easy for programmers to do their work without getting confused or frustrated.

#### Why It’s Great: Making It Easy and Fun

With platform engineering, programmers don’t need to learn all the complicated tools. Instead, they get a simple, easy-to-use toolbox that lets them focus on creating cool new programs and features. It’s like spending more time playing with your train set and less time figuring out how to put it together.

In short, platform engineering helps programmers by giving them everything they need in one place, making their work easier and more fun – just like having the perfect toolbox for your toy train set!

### What does a platform engineer do?

Platform engineers usually work on the platform team to build an Internal Developer Platform. They often work with Docker/Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Platforms are typically built as a layer on top of clusters and infrastructure, simplifying both configuration management and infrastructure orchestration.

### Platform Engineering Tools

An Internal Developer Platform is a collection of all the technology and tools that a platform engineering team combines to create an easy-to-use system. Developers use this system to work independently with minimal mental effort.

### Platform Engineering vs. SRE: What's the Difference?

#### Meet Alex the SRE

* **Role:** Ensures systems run smoothly and reliably.
    
* **Tasks:** Manages availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning.
    
* **Goal:** Balance reliability and innovation using SLOs and error budgets.
    

#### Meet Jamie the Platform Engineer

* **Role:** Builds tools and systems for developers.
    
* **Tasks:** Creates an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), enables developer self-service, and reduces cognitive load.
    
* **Goal:** Make it easy for developers to build and deploy applications.
    

**The Difference:**

* **Focus:** Alex focuses on the reliability of the production environment. Jamie focuses on creating a smooth, self-service experience for developers.
    
* **Impact:** Alex ensures the system runs well. Jamie empowers developers to work efficiently.
    

**Why Both Are Important ?**

* **Alex (SRE):** Keeps the system stable and reliable.
    
* **Jamie (Platform Engineer):** Provides the tools and environment for developers to innovate and build new features quickly.
    

I hope you enjoy this blog and gain a comprehensive understanding of what platform engineering entails. Platform engineering is a crucial aspect of modern software development, focusing on creating robust tools and systems that empower developers. By building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), platform engineers like Jamie enable developers to work independently with minimal mental effort, allowing them to concentrate on innovation and feature development. This blog aims to shed light on the significant role platform engineers play in streamlining the development process and enhancing overall productivity.
