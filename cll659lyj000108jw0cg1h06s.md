Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It comes with a wide variety of tools for security assessments, including many that can be used for penetration testing.

Penetration testing is the process of simulating an attack on a computer system or network in order to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. It is an important part of security assessment, and Kali Linux is a powerful tool that can be used to perform penetration testing. Here are some of the most popular tools used in Kali Linux for documentation:

1. **Armitage:** Armitage is a scriptable red team collaboration tool for Metasploit that visualize targets, recommends exploits, and exposes the advanced post- exploitation features in the framework Installation and Implementation is as following-
    
    `sudo apt install armitage`
    
    ```plaintext
    root@kali:~# teamserver -h
    [*] You must provide: <external IP address> <team password>
        <external IP address> must be reachable by Armitage
              clients on port 55553
        <team password> is a shared password your team uses to
              authenticate to the Armitage team server
    ```
    
2. Nmap: A port scanner that can be used to identify open ports on a remote system. It can also be used to scan for vulnerabilities in network services.Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques, version detection (determine service protocols and application versions listening behind ports), and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification). You can install packages as -
    
    `sudo apt install nmap-common`
    
    ```plaintext
    root@kali:~# nmap -v -A -sV 192.168.1.1
